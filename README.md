# Technologies Used

* Node.JS
* Express
* MongoDB

# Guidelines
The idea of this project is user will have to register a new account first before they decide their actions. After done creating a new account, user can login and choose to **BUY** or **SELL** items. In the **BUY** section, user can browse through all the products posted from the **SELL** section and add the products they wanted to buy into the cart. Next they will proceed to the **CHECKOUT PAGE** after finish shopping. In the **SELL** section, user will post the product they wanted to sell and key in the info of their products before selling it.

# Roadblock
The main roadblock I face in this project is unable to link up MongoDB to stored user login information to do testing which lead to unable to preview the remaining functions whether they work as intended.

# Future Plans
As this project is not fully develop yet, there are much to do in coming times that will be listed down below: 

1. Make sure MongoDB is linked and fully function when user register their new account.
2. User enable to select Buy or Sell after logging in.
3. In buying section, can add in a search tab to ease user on searching item they wanted to buy.
4. In selling section, can add in user bank account details so when payment successful from buyer side able to transfer to seller directly.
5. Stripe payment gateway added in.
