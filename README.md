# Technologies Used

* Node.JS
* Express
* MongoDB

# Guidelines
In this project, user will have to register a new account first before they decide their actions. 

# Roadblock
The main roadblock I face in this project is unable to link up MongoDB to stored user login information to do testing which lead to unable to preview the remaining functions whether they work as intended.

# Future Plans
As this project is not fully develop yet, there are much to do in coming times that will be listed down below: 

1. Make sure MongoDB is linked and fully function when user register their new account.
2. User enable to select Buy or Sell after logging in.
3. 
4. Stripe payment gateway added in.
5.
